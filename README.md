# Three.js project (JavaScript library)

Three.js is a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics and animations in web browsers. It simplifies the use of WebGL, a technology for 3D graphics in browsers. With three.js, you can easily build 3D scenes, add objects, apply materials and lighting, create animations, and make interactive experiences. It's widely used by developers to bring 3D visuals to web applications without dealing directly with low-level WebGL code.

I wanted to make this an interactive sketch using three.js. I didn't know much about JavaScript or three.js at first, so I broke the whole thing into smaller parts I could handle. Basically, I'd move on to the next step whenever I felt like I knew enough about the current part. So in this project, you'll see not just the final sketch, but also the practice assignments I did to learn and finally put it all together.

- Assignment 1: Basic javascript project: https://codepen.io/VascaM/pen/qMMjGw
- Assignment 2: Basic three.js project: https://codepen.io/VascaM/pen/KxGMzd
- Assignment 3: Add shadows + Dat GUI in three.js: https://codepen.io/VascaM/pen/MqRVOz 
  - The Dat.GUI tool adds a very basic user interface which allows us to interact with our 3D scene and the objects within it.
- Assignment 4: Add particles with three.js: https://codepen.io/VascaM/pen/VGJXpO
- Assignment 5: Add a skybox with three.js: https://codepen.io/VascaM/pen/BqNJWX
- Assignment 6: Load a 3D object with three.js: https://codepen.io/VascaM/pen/KGVbKJ 
- Assignment 7: Move planes with three.js: https://codepen.io/VascaM/pen/pxdeWG 
- Assignment 8: Load an animated 3D object with three.js: https://codepen.io/VascaM/pen/VEGYrX
